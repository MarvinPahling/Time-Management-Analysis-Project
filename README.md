# Time Management Analysis Project

## Introduction

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook (`Zeiteinteilung.ipynb`) for analyzing and visualizing time management data. The notebook uses Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and openpyxl for data manipulation and visualization.

## Prerequisites

To run the notebook, you need to have Conda installed on your system. Conda is an open-source package management system and environment management system that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the environment for this project:

### Step 1: Install Conda

If you do not have Conda installed, download and install it from [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). Miniconda is a smaller, lightweight version of Anaconda.

### Step 2: Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone [URL to this repository]
```
### Step 3: Create a Conda Environment
Navigate to the cloned repository folder and create a Conda environment with all the necessary dependencies:

```bash
conda create -n time_analysis python=3.8 pandas seaborn matplotlib openpyxl jupyter
```

### Step 4: Activate the Environment
Activate the Conda environment:

```bash
conda activate time_analysis
```

### Step 5: Launch Jupyter Notebook
With the environment activated, start the Jupyter Notebook server:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Navigate to Zeiteinteilung.ipynb in the Jupyter Notebook interface to open and run the notebook.

## Usage

After launching Jupyter Notebook, you can view and run the cells in Zeiteinteilung.ipynb. The notebook is interactive, allowing for modification and execution of the Python code.
