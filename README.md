# Time Management Analysis Project

## Introduction

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook (`Zeiteinteilung.ipynb`) for analyzing and visualizing time management data. The notebook uses Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and openpyxl for data manipulation and visualization.

## Prerequisites

To run the notebook, you need to have Conda installed on your system. Conda is an open-source package management system and environment management system that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
